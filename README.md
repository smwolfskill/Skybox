# Skybox
Simple Skybox web app which allows the user to dynamically view a 3D model with or without HD environment reflections while in a small city skybox.

The simplest way to launch the app is to create a local server using python 3 in a command-line interface.
Once you're in the source code directory, run the python server on port 8000:

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Or if you have python 2,

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Then open the app in your browser:

`localhost:8000/Teapot.html`

To quit the server (unix) simply hit `CTRL^C` in command-line.
